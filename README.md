What is Skill meter?

Skill meter is a simple system written with HTML5, CSS3, PHP and Mysql to measure your skills in different areas that you have acquired in a professional or personal level. By admin panel, you can quickly and easily put your skills and categorize them.

How to use it?

Save your categories such as programming, languages, design, sports or whatever you want.
Then set up your skills. You have to choose the right category. You decide how much percent you will rate on your skill and complete the required fields for the name of the skill
Add an icon for it, if itâ€™s not in the list you can add your own icon by selecting from the image upload field. What you are uploading do not need to be calibrated accurately, you need at least roughly in the same ratio of height, as 240x240px.
You can add unlimited number of icons. Put them in the root directory of the script in a folder img / icons.
After you have entered your skills and categories you can easily arrange them with drag and drop. You need to select the directory where they are located, so you can move them around.
How to install?

Create database on your Mysql server and name it skill_meter.
Import SQL file located in the directory sql to create table stricture in database skill_meter.
Open global.php file located in the directory admin. Set your $mysql_username and $mysql_password to connect to MySQL database and change your custom $admin_username and $admin_username to access to admin panel.
Use it :)!
Skill meter is free to use and change the code.
